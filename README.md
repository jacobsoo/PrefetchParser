PrefetchParser
==============

This is just a simple Prefetch Parser developed in C#.


PrefetchParser is an application to extract information from Windows Prefetch files. 


Basically, Prefetch files provide useful information during a forensic investigation such as the date the application was last run and the number of times the application has run. 


The file format is relatively straight forward, although there are difference between the different binary formats between XP and Vista/7 and Windows 8.
